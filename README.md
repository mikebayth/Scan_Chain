This system is designed to provide a testing setup for any CPLD / FPGA based 
system. The user will be able to load the input combinations, and apply them on the
system. Also, the output could be taken out and compared against the expected value.
The tester module has to be added along with the userâ€™s device (DUT) on the hardware,
and the pins should be connected to the microcontroller. Then, just by giving the input
file containing the commands the test will be carried out and the results will be displayed.
